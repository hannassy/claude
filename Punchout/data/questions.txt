I have few steps and questions to them:
1. https://tirehub.test/punchout/request/initiate (ONLY FOR CARMAX)
    - expect GET request with post/get items of interests params
        - dealerCode (required)
        - partnerIdentity (required)
        - itemId
        - quantityNeeded
    - validate dealerCode via 'lookupdealer'
    - validate partnerIdentity via 'getpunchoutpartners'
    - store request into db and want to redirect user to 'punchoutRedirectUrl' from 'getpunchoutpartners'
        but it is empty for 'Hertz' (IS THIS CORRECT?)
    - also i generate a token (or session key) and want to add it to redirect url
        and use further it as 'BuyerCookie' for next step (IS THIS CORRECT?)
2. https://tirehub.test/punchout/setup/process
    - expect post cXML request with credentials (identity, domain, shared_secret) which should match with data from 'getpunchoutpartners'
    - for CARMAX redirect to lookuplist location by corporateAddressId from 'getpunchoutpartners'
    - expect locationId for step3 to use for adding to cart (FOR HERTZ)
    - if exist userEmail - set this email to preffered email
        - check if customer exists
            - if not - create, should I use address (for default shipping/billing) from cXML request if it is present
    - expect BuyerCookie which were generated on step1 (or just from cXML) and find dealerCode/partnerIdentity and/or items of interests
    - on succes send cXML 200 response with PunchOutSetupResponse->StartPage->Url = https://tirehub.test/punchout/shopping/start + crypted BuyerCookie
    - on fail send cXML 400 response with error message
3. https://tirehub.test/punchout/shopping/start
    - select locationID page if needed
    - expect token (BuyerCookie) which is generated on step1 to find relations in db
    - add products to cart (if requested before) with locationId from step2 (or take primary locationId from created user)
    - if items are added - redirect user to the cart
    - some logic if not...
